## Overview

This notebook presents a **data cleaning and modeling pipeline** aiming to predict real estate prices in Belgium, using enriched and carefully prepared datasets with data from Immoweb.

## 1. Data Loading

- Load the main dataset of property listings (`Kangaroo.csv`).
- Enrich the data by merging with an auxiliary dataset (`data.csv`) containing latitude/longitude, energy consumption, and cadastral information.

## 2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Using the function `cleaning_dataframe(df)`:
- **Map EPC scores (A‚ÄìG)** to region-specific numerical energy values.
- **Remove or correct outliers** in various columns.
- **Advanced boolean handling** (replace NaN, convert to integer type).
- **Aggregate features** (e.g., total parking count).
- **Supervised categorical encoding** (label encoding for property subtype, province, etc.).
- **Conditional imputation and replacement** (e.g., set garden/terrace surfaces to 0 if absent).
- Drop rows with missing key features or inconsistent values.

## 3. Train/Test Split & Targeted Imputation

Using the function `cleaning_traintestsplit(df_split)`:
- Applied **independently** to `X_train` and `X_test` to prevent data leakage.
- Impute missing values in key variables using mode or median, depending on data type.
- Cast selected categorical variables to `int` for modeling.
- Optionally drop rows still having missing values after imputation.

## 4. Preprocessing (Standardization)

- Apply standardization (`StandardScaler`) to numerical explanatory variables.
- Prepare features for the machine learning model.

<a id="model-eval"></a>
## 5. Model Training & Evaluation

- **Model used:** 
XGBoost Regressor, configured with:
  - `n_estimators=3000`
  - `random_state=43`
  - `learning_rate=0.05`
  - `subsample=0.8`
- **Performance metrics:**
  - **R¬≤:** 0.83
  - **RMSE:** ‚Ç¨77,260
  - **MAE:** ‚Ç¨51,690
  - **MSE:** 5.97 √ó 10‚Åπ

## Reproducibility

To use or adapt this notebook:

1. Install required Python packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost
2. Place the data files in your working directory.
3. Run all notebook cells in order, or adapt the functions to match your own data schemas.
